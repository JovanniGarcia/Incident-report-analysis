## Introduction

I work as a **Cybersecurity Analyst** at a multimedia company that specializes in web design, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions for small businesses. Our recent experience with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack highlighted the critical importance of network security. This incident caused a disruption in our internal network for two hours before we successfully mitigated the threat.

## The DDoS Attack

During the attack, our network services abruptly ceased functioning due to an overwhelming influx of ICMP packets. This caused a halt in regular internal network activities, rendering our network resources inaccessible. Our incident management team swiftly responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, shutting down non-essential network services temporarily, and eventually restoring critical network functions.

## Investigation and Analysis

Following the incident, our cybersecurity team conducted a thorough investigation. Their findings revealed that a malicious actor had exploited a vulnerability in an unconfigured firewall to flood our network with ICMP pings. This exploitation led to the DDoS attack, overwhelming our network's capacity.

## Strengthening Our Security Posture

In response to this security breach, our network security team implemented the following measures to enhance our security posture:

- Implemented a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
- Enforced source IP address verification on the firewall to identify and prevent spoofed IP addresses in incoming ICMP packets.
- Deployed network monitoring software to detect any irregular traffic patterns.
- Established an Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter out suspicious ICMP traffic based on specific characteristics.

## Moving Forward with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

As part of my role as a cybersecurity analyst, I am leveraging this security incident to develop a comprehensive plan for bolstering our company's network security. This plan aligns with the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, guiding me through a series of steps to analyze the incident and integrate the findings into a broader security strategy:

1. **Identify Security Risks**: Conduct routine audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to pinpoint potential security gaps.

2. **Protect Internal Assets**: Implement well-defined policies, procedures, training programs, and tools to mitigate various cybersecurity threats and protect our internal assets.

3. **Enhance Detection Capabilities**: Improve monitoring capabilities to swiftly detect potential security incidents and expedite the identification process.

4. **Formulate a Robust Response Strategy**: Develop a response strategy to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents. Incorporate lessons learned to enhance overall security processes.

5. **Ensure Smooth Recovery**: Establish a recovery process for affected systems, restoring normal operations and recovering any compromised systems data or assets resulting from the incident.

By adhering to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, my goal is to meticulously navigate through each of these steps, enabling us to address the current incident and strengthen our company's overall network security posture.
